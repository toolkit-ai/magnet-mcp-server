# Canary MCP Server Setup

Walk me through setting up this MCP server to use the Magnet canary environment at https://canary.magnet.run.

Follow the canary-setup skill instructions in `.claude/skills/canary-setup/SKILL.md` to:

1. Check prerequisites (Node.js >= 22.2.0, pnpm, dependencies)
2. Build the project with `pnpm build`
3. Help me configure my Magnet API key from the canary environment
4. Detect which MCP client I'm using and find my settings file
5. Add the canary server configuration to my MCP client
6. Verify the setup works

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather information interactively as needed.
