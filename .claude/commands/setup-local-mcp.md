# Local MCP Server Setup

Walk me through setting up this MCP server for local development and testing.

Follow the local-setup skill instructions in `.claude/skills/local-setup/SKILL.md` to:

1. Check prerequisites (Node.js >= 22.2.0, pnpm, dependencies)
2. Build the project with `pnpm build`
3. Help me configure my Magnet API key
4. Detect which MCP client I'm using and find my settings file
5. Add the local server configuration to my MCP client
6. Verify the setup works

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to gather information interactively as needed.
